## Why We Built This
The current condition of COVID-19 has impacted a lot of small businesses due to less customers visiting a physical store. 
Small businesses in general also find it difficult to find new suppliers and handle their inventory effectively as they
are new to the business environment. 
We have provided a solution to the small business merchants where they can connect with each other and manage their business effectively.
